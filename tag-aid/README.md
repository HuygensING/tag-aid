This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). This allowed to speed up setting configuration parameters and creating optimized builds. Once the application will be stable, it could be [ejected](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#converting-to-a-custom-setup), making any configuration file  completely accessible for custom configuration.

In addition to Create React App, the current version of tag-aid is based on:

* [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux): for managing states and state schanges
* [Redux-Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga): for managing side-effects, such as those that may be related to HTTP calls to the API
* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/): for drawing the Sankey diagram
* [React Bottstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/): for easier bootstrap integration using React components
